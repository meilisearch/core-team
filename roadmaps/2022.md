# Roadmap 2022

This is the roadmap planned by the core team at Meilisearch for the year 2022.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not the product roadmap that is available on the product team side, but the main goal to reach for the core team in general.

Nothing is definitive: the roadmap can be adapted depending on the need of the users and the company.

## 2022: the main lines

### Road to Meilisearch v1 üöÄ

The product team plans a lot of changes to stabilize the API during 2022. The core team should not only be ready regarding these requirements but also regarding the processes to be able to release stable versions of Meilisearch.

The workflows and the automation, including milli and the tokenizer, should be improved. We need to be clear about any process; for example, we need to define what we consider as breaking or not for a stabilized version.

It also means being more "professional" by building strong tests improving our benchmarks so that we can anticipate the failures and the loss of performance.

### Keep working with the community üë•

We strongly believe building a product in open source is the safest way to provide a product that will last in the long term. We indeed think the community is one of our biggest advantages since we get contributions, but also feedback that is also very valuable. Plus, having the code in public enforce us to work in a clean and clear way. This makes it more reliable in the long term.

We want to increase the participation regarding fixes (quick or not), technical discussions where we would need more insights, and any feedback in general.

### Recruitments ü¶Ä

Since we want to focus on more technical tasks, the core team needs to hire experts and senior people.

We also plan to hire an intern to make them discover open-source and fall in love with Rust. This will make Meilisearch more visible but also attract young developers. Our final plan would be to start a kind of internship program in the future if we have the possibility regarding the HR team.

### More R&D phases üîç

In the past year, we were mostly focused on refactoring the search engine (v0.21.0) and right after on adding new features. This leads to the following issue: we don't know our search engine perfectly. For example, we don't perfectly know the limits and what are potential improvements we could make.

We need to take time by testing and trying things in our own codebase to be aware of our limits but also to ease our decision-making in the future by knowing what is doable or not.

### Find the good rhythm üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Compared to the past year, we now have a more complex codebase, and we have to change our release rhythm. We want to find the best way to handle our releases regarding our needs, but also depending on the product team and on the other teams.

This would probably involve trying different ways of working to find what fits the most. We need to find the right balance between the R&D phases, maintenance, and implementation.

### Work with the other teams ü§ù

Since Meilisearch is famous for attracting professional developers, developing a single core engine is not enough. Especially, we need to work with the docs team and the integration team. During this year, we will need to integrate the Cloud team into our process too.

To release a complete feature, we need to be coordinate with all the team to ensure the best search experience. This would involve more and more synchronization and work between the teams.

### Improve the search engine experience üõ†

Regarding this point, more details are available on the product team roadmap, but here are the main goals:
- Tenant tokens
- Nested fields
- Federated search
- Enhance some customization
- Improve the indexation speed
- Improve the tokenizer
- Stabalize the API routes, essential for the Cloud team

## Q1 2022

- [ ] Change the Meilisearch release rhythm and adapt the team to it. 4 weeks of implementation / 4 weeks of pre-release.
- [ ] Do the first pre-release tasks, i.e., discovery/R&D/maintainance tasks between 2 sprints.
- [ ] Start the first R&D regarding indexation speed improvement.
- [ ] Implement, or at least, start working on the required features by the product team (nested fields, federated search)
- [ ] Start the recruitment process to hire an expert to help us with the technical parts.
- [ ] Start the recruitment process to hire an intern.
